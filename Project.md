Course Project
==============

## Blog

In this project we will create a simple blog application in several steps.

Throughout several iterations during our lab classes we were building a blog
application with _Node.js_, _Express_, _Sequelize_, and _MySQL_. The sources of
our final application can be found [here](https://github.com/toksaitov/blog).
For your final exam you have to redo every part on your own to be able to defend
it. For grades _B_ or _A_, you also have to complete a take-home Assignment in
one week.

### Lab Tasks

1. A user can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) the blog entries. The
   entries can be stored in memory for now.

2. Add different types of users to the system. An administrator can do basic
   CRUD operations on blog entries. Other users can only read them.

3. Add commenting support to the blog. All authenticated users can post comments
   under blog entries.

4. We have tried using raw SQL queries in our _guestbook_ application. Now we
   will try to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system _Sequelize_ to move
   our in-memory data storage to the MySQL database.

### Take-home Assignment

To defend your project for a grade of _B_ or _A_, you need to add one major
feature or make one major improvement to the system. This could be...

* Improve navigation (add a navigation bar with links), add some general
  information pages such as an about page...
* Allow users to manage their comments and administrators to manage all comments
  (update, delete)
* Add a registration form for new users
* Add markdown support for blog posts
* Add proper styling for all pages
* Add client-side JS code to check for errors or to dynamically update content
  with [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))
* Turn it into SPA (Single-Page-Application) with React
* Add [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
